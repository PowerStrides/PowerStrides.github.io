    <h3> Piezoelectric Shoe Sole </h3>
    <h6> Project Description </h6>
    <p> As population and energy consumption per capita continues to grow, scaling energy production in an environmentally sustainable manner becomes paramount. This project aims to produce a line of apparel with broad appeal capable of recycling the energy supplied by the user into electricity. The sources for this electric generation will be threefold: compressive forces from running, body heat, and rotary motion from a bending knee. First, the mechanical stress while running will be converted into electricity by incorporating piezoelectric technology into a shoe midsole and a knee brace. Second, the thermal energy from body heat will be converted into electricity utilizing thermoelectric materials. Finally, using a network of gears, and an electromagnetic generator, the rotary motion of a bending knee can be used to turn the axle on a generator to produce electricity. This solution targets consumers with an active lifestyle, specifically runners, hikers/campers, and frequent foot commuters. Additionally, since this product line aims to generate sustainable energy, it appeals to environmentally conscious consumers. The product will be marketed as a lifestyle because it seeks to combine sustainability with physical activity.
