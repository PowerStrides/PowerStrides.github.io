    <h3> Piezoelectric Shoe Sole </h3>
    
    <h2> Project Description </h2>
    <p> As population and energy consumption per capita continues to grow, scaling energy production in an environmentally sustainable manner
        becomes paramount. This project aims to produce a line of apparel with broad appeal capable of recycling the energy supplied by the 
        user into electricity. The sources for this electric generation will be threefold: compressive forces from running, body heat, and 
        rotary motion from a bending knee. 
        <br> <br>
        First, the mechanical stress while running will be converted into electricity by incorporating 
        piezoelectric technology into a shoe midsole and a knee brace. Second, the thermal energy from body heat will be converted into 
        electricity utilizing thermoelectric materials. Finally, using a network of gears, and an electromagnetic generator, the rotary 
        motion of a bending knee can be used to turn the axle on a generator to produce electricity. This solution targets consumers with an 
        active lifestyle, specifically runners, hikers/campers, and frequent foot commuters. Additionally, since this product line aims to 
        generate sustainable energy, it appeals to environmentally conscious consumers. The product will be marketed as a lifestyle because 
        it seeks to combine sustainability with physical activity.
        <br> <br>
        our product innovation is a shoe sole that anyone can put into their shoe to produce renewable electrical energy through cutting edge
        piezoelectric technology to harness mechanical compression energy from every step. Currently, we have a prototype that has the basic 
        main components and ideas incorporated but needs significant design changes for fashion and efficiency. </p>
        
    <h2> Competitor Research </h2>
    <p> Additional companies active in this space include Voltaic Systems and Pvilion. Both companies develop apparel and equipment products, specifically bags and tents, incorporating electricity generation. However, their products either lack adequate portability for the typical outdoorsman or inefficiently and unreliably generate electricity since they rely solely on solar power. Through our product line, however, the user can generate electricity from many sources, including mechanical or thermal energy, rather than relying on a singular source, like solar power.
        Other companies that generate electricity in unique ways include Pavegen and Loomia. Pavegen is a company that designs floor tiles that produce electricity when pressure is exerted on the material. Additionally, Loomia produces a flexible material capable of generating electricity. However, these companies mainly focus on producing tiles or fabric capable of generating electricity instead of integrating the electricity generation within clothing. Our product line aims to make electricity generation more seamless and less noticeable on the clothes.
        Finally, the company Thermogen focuses on generating electricity from body heat, specifically through utilizing thermoelectric materials. However, this company aims to recycle the thermal energy emitted by the user to keep a jacket warm. In contrast, our products aim to extract and store the energy from human movement.</p>
